# Excel

# Alex the Analyst Bootcamp
I polished my Microsoft Excel skills for topics including Pivot Tables, a variety of formulas, XLOOKUP, conditional formatting, charts, and cleaning data. All of these can be found as files in this repository and I have shown the formulas used and the explanations for what my goal for each of these were, such as finding the corresponding email for an employee.

I also completed a project in Excel for bike sales, including cleaning data, clarifying and simplifying the data, and creating a dashboard to summarize the data. I have also logged the steps taken, formulas used, and the purpose and result of each of my steps.
